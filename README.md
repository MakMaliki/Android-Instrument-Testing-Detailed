# Android-Instrument-Testing-Detailed

import android.content.Context;

import androidx.test.ext.junit.runners.AndroidJUnit4;
import androidx.test.platform.app.InstrumentationRegistry;

import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

import static org.junit.Assert.*;

@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4.class)
public class ExampleInstrumentedTest {

    @Test
    public void useAppContext() {
        // Context of the app under test.
        Context appContext = InstrumentationRegistry.getInstrumentation().getTargetContext();

        assertEquals("com.example.myapp", appContext.getPackageName());
    }
}

In this example, we're testing that the context returned by InstrumentationRegistry matches the package name of our app. We're using the AndroidJUnit4 runner to run our test. You can run this test by right-clicking on the class in Android Studio and selecting "Run 'ExampleInstrumentedTest'".



Android Instrumentation tests are automated tests that allow developers to test their apps on real devices or emulators. These tests are executed on a device or emulator and can interact with the app's UI, APIs, and other components. Here are some benefits of Android Instrumentation tests:

Comprehensive testing: Android Instrumentation tests provide comprehensive testing of an app's functionality. These tests can be used to validate UI flows, user input, and output, and API interactions.
Example: A developer can use an Android Instrumentation test to validate that when the user enters their credentials, the app authenticates the user, and the correct screen is displayed.

Early bug detection: Android instrument tests can help detect bugs early in the development cycle. By running automated tests on every code change, developers can quickly identify and fix bugs before they become more complex and difficult to fix.

Continuous Integration: Instrumentation tests can be easily integrated into a continuous integration (CI) pipeline, allowing for automated testing with each code change. This helps to catch any bugs or errors early in the development cycle, reducing the time and effort required for debugging.

Integration testing: Android Instrumentation tests can be used to validate that an app integrates correctly with other components or services.
Example: A developer can use an Android Instrumentation test to validate that when the app interacts with a backend service, the correct data is displayed in the app.


Faster feedback: Android Instrumentation tests can provide faster feedback to developers than manual testing. These tests can be executed on multiple devices or emulators in parallel, which can reduce testing time.
Example: A developer can run an Android Instrumentation test on multiple devices in parallel to validate that the app works correctly on all supported devices.


db devices - Displays the list of connected devices and emulators.

adb shell - Opens a remote shell to run commands on the device.

adb install - Installs an APK file on the device.

adb uninstall - Uninstalls an app from the device.

adb push - Copies a file or directory from the local system to the device.

adb pull - Copies a file or directory from the device to the local system.

adb logcat - Displays the device log messages in real-time.

adb bugreport - Generates a bug report for the device.

adb shell dumpsys - Dumps system information for debugging purposes.

adb shell am - Sends an intent to the device, such as starting an activity.

adb shell pm - Manages package information for installed apps.

adb shell input - Sends keyboard or touch events to the device.

adb shell screencap - Captures a screenshot of the device display.

adb shell screenrecord - Records a video of the device screen.

adb shell monkey - Runs a random series of events to stress-test the device.

adb shell settings - Manipulates system settings on the device.

adb logcat -c - Clears the log buffer on the device.

adb shell setprop - Sets a system property on the device.

adb shell getprop - Retrieves a system property from the device.

adb shell dumpstate - Collects and prints diagnostic information about the device.

These commands can be used to interact with the device and perform various tasks during instrumentation testing.


Basic ADB Commands for Instrumentation Testing
adb devices: Lists all connected devices and emulators.
adb shell: Opens a shell on the connected device or emulator.
adb install: Installs an APK on the connected device or emulator.
adb uninstall: Uninstalls an APK from the connected device or emulator.
Instrumentation Testing Commands
adb shell am instrument: Runs instrumentation tests on the connected device or emulator. The command takes several arguments, including:
-w: Waits for the test to complete before returning.
-e: Sets an instrumentation argument. This can be used to pass data to the test or configure its behavior.
-p: Specifies the package containing the test.
-f: Specifies the test filter. This can be used to run specific tests.
-c: Specifies the test class to run.
adb shell pm list instrumentation: Lists all available instrumentation tests on the connected device or emulator.
adb shell am force-stop: Stops an application on the connected device or emulator.
adb shell am start: Starts an activity on the connected device or emulator.
adb shell input: Simulates user input on the connected device or emulator. This can be used to automate tests.
adb shell getprop: Gets a system property from the connected device or emulator. This can be used to retrieve information about the device or emulator, such as its Android version.
Advanced ADB Commands for Instrumentation Testing
adb logcat: Displays the device or emulator's log messages. This can be used to debug issues with the application or test.
adb shell dumpsys: Dumps various system information about the device or emulator, such as the list of running services or the state of the activity manager.
adb shell setprop: Sets a system property on the connected device or emulator. This can be used to configure the device or emulator for testing purposes.
adb shell screenrecord: Records a video of the device or emulator's screen. This can be used to create screencasts of the application or test.
adb shell screencap: Takes a screenshot of the device or emulator's screen. This can be used to visually verify the behavior of the application or test.
Conclusion
ADB Android Instrumentation Testing commands are essential for developers who want to ensure their application works as intended.
By using ADB, developers can run instrumentation tests, simulate user input, and retrieve system information from the device or emulator.
Advanced ADB commands can also be used to debug issues with the application or test, record videos, and take screenshots.
